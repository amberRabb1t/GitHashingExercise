# GitHashingExercise

This project has to do with hashing.

The script "hash_script" (implemented in the bash shell) takes a 4-digit integer as input and outputs a hash of it, using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

For a given input, the output will be written to the file "hash_output.txt" (creating it, if it doesn't exist), overwriting its previous content.

Currently, "hash_output.txt" contains the output that corresponds to the input "0396" [last four digits of my student ID (AEM)].
