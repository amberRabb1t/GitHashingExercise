# GitHashingExercise

This project has to do with hashing.

The script "hash_script" (implemented in the bash shell) takes a 4-digit integer as input and outputs a hash of the input, using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

The file "hash_output.txt" contains the output of the script, for the given input.

Currently, it contains the output that corresponds to the input "0396" [last four digits of my student ID (AEM)].
